# GatorRealm
CEN4721 HCI Project
Enter a world of adventure, magic, and peril when you step into GATOR REALM! 
Create up to 8 characters, forming heroes and villains from a robust set of options. 
Choose different options for appearance and personality for each character, and set them on the trail of their own destinies! 

To run the GATOR REALM repo on your own computer, you'll need the Unity Hub and Unity v2021.3.25f1, which can
be downloaded from Unity's website. Once you clone the repo locally, you'll use the Unity Hub to open the project.

To run Orange Version, open the project from the main branch; to run Blue Version, open the project from the Blue Version branch.

If you want to avoid the complexity of installing and opening Unity, look at our itch.io page to download a double-pack of the Orange and Blue builds:
